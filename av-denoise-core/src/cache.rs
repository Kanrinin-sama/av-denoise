//! Where CubeCL keeps its compiled kernels.
//!
//! Compiling this crate's kernels takes about ten seconds, and CubeCL
//! caches nothing on its own. Its cache setting defaults to `None`, so
//! every run recompiles from scratch unless something points it at a
//! directory.
//!
//! [`install_compilation_cache`] points it at one. By default that is
//! `av-denoise` inside the user's cache directory, which turns the ten
//! seconds into a cost paid once per machine rather than once per run.
//! A warm cache takes the 53-frame reference clip from 11.8 s to 1.3 s.
//!
//! The `AV_DENOISE_COMPILATION_CACHE` environment variable overrides the
//! location, which is what CI runs and containers use to put the cache
//! on a mounted volume. Setting it to `off` disables caching entirely,
//! which is what benchmarking wants, because a warm cache hides the
//! compilation cost that a first run pays.
//!
//! [`install_compilation_cache`] has to run before the first
//! [`Denoiser`](crate::Denoiser) is created, because building a CubeCL
//! client locks the global config.
