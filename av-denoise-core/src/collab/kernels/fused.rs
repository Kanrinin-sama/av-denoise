/// Groups each reference patch with the patches most similar to it,
/// filters the whole group jointly with a hard threshold in the

/// own frame.
///
/// # Work decomposition
///
/// One cube of 64 threads owns eight reference patches. Each 8-lane
/// group owns one of them, and lane `sub` of a group owns column `sub`
/// of every patch that group touches. That one mapping serves both
/// halves of the kernel. A candidate's 64 pixel differences are spread
/// eight ways during matching, and [`plane_ssd_reduce8`] folds the eight
/// column sums into the whole patch distance. A member's 64 filtered
/// pixels are spread the same eight ways during filtering, so both the
/// candidate reads and the scatter writes are coalesced.
///
/// The reference patch's own column stays in registers for the whole
/// matching phase. Candidate pixels are read straight from global
/// memory. Neighbouring reference patches search heavily overlapping
/// windows at a step of 4, so the cache already serves those reads well
/// and a shared-memory tile would only cost occupancy.
///
/// A row of references rarely divides into eights, so the last cube of
/// a row runs groups whose reference patch is past the end. A 1080p
/// frame has 479 references across, so this is a shipped path rather
/// than an edge case. Those groups stay live through the whole kernel,
/// working on a clamped copy of the last real reference, and are gated
/// only where they would write.
///
/// # Barriers
///
/// [`transpose8`] carries the only barrier inside the group-processing
/// loops. Every lane of the cube reaches it the same number of times,
/// because the transposes sit in fully unrolled loops with no run-time
/// condition around them. Nothing returns early, a dead group runs the
/// whole kernel, and the group size only ever gates which iterations do
/// arithmetic, never how many barriers a lane reaches. A workgroup
/// barrier reached by only part of the workgroup is undefined, so that
/// property is what the write gating and the clamped reference index
/// exist to preserve.
///
/// The basis fill carries one more barrier, before either transform
/// runs. It is unconditional and sits before `live` is computed, so
/// every lane reaches it whatever the reference index later clamps to.
///
/// # Search space
///
/// The centre frame contributes the `spatial_radius` rectangle around
/// the reference patch, clipped to the frame. Each neighbour
/// contributes the `refine` rectangle around the position the motion
/// field predicts the reference patch moved to, clipped the same way.
///
/// Clipping the rectangle once is what keeps every candidate a distinct
/// position. Clamping each offset in turn would land several offsets on
/// the same edge position, and admitting a position twice would let one
/// physical patch count as two and look like stronger agreement than
/// the group has.
///
/// # Distance
///
/// A candidate's distance is the channel-scaled sum of squared pixel
/// differences over the whole patch, minus `noise_floor`. `noise_floor`
/// is the distance two noisy copies of the same content show by chance,
/// so a genuine match is not penalised for the noise it carries. The
/// result is not clamped at zero, because subtracting a constant from
/// every candidate shifts them all equally and leaves the ranking
/// unchanged.
///
/// # No admission gate
///
/// Every candidate stays in the running whatever its distance, so a
/// group fills to `k_max` wherever the search space is that large.
/// `c_min` is a compute saving rather than an admission threshold. A
/// neighbour whose block confidence sits below it never runs the pixel
/// comparison, and its whole rectangle is skipped. The confidence comes
/// from one motion block that every lane of the group shares, so the
/// skip is uniform across the group.
///
/// # Selection
///
/// The eight best candidates live one per lane, ascending, and each
/// candidate is offered to [`shift_insert8_gated`] as it is scored. A
/// candidate that ties an incumbent does not displace it, so the first
/// candidate seen at a given distance keeps its slot. The self-match is
/// scored with a sentinel distance below every real one, which pins it
/// into slot 0 without a special case in the loop.
///
/// # Members
///
/// A member is a `(distance, position)` pair for the whole search, and
/// nothing else rides along. The position packs the neighbour it came
/// from into the bits above the coordinates, so the frame it was matched
/// in and its motion-block confidence are both recovered from the packed
/// word when matching ends. Carrying either through the insert would
/// cost a shuffle on every candidate.
///
/// The member set never leaves the kernel. Lane `i` holds member `i`, so
/// one broadcast per member is all the filter stage needs to give every
/// lane every position.
///
/// # Group size
///
/// The member count is the search space size rounded down to the
/// nearest power of two, capped at `k_max`. The stack transform is only
/// defined for power-of-two stack sizes, so a count of 5, 6, or 7 keeps
/// only 4 members. Every rectangle this kernel searches at shipped
/// settings is far larger than `k_max`, so the rounding only bites on
/// frames small enough for the clipped rectangle to hold fewer than
/// eight positions.
///
/// # What the filter does
///
/// For each active channel, every member's patch runs through a 2D DCT,
/// so each patch is described by 64 frequency coefficients instead of 64
/// pixel values. A Haar transform then runs across the stack axis, at
/// each spatial position independently, so content the group agrees on
/// collects into the low stack levels and content only one or two
/// members carry lands in the higher ones. A coefficient survives a hard
/// threshold when its magnitude reaches `lambda_ht` standard deviations
/// of its own propagated noise, with [`variance_reg_level`] propagating
/// the per-member variance to each stack level. Both transforms then
/// invert.
///
/// The spatial pass runs as a column DCT in registers, a transpose, and
/// a row DCT in registers, because a lane owns a column and the row pass
/// needs a row. The inverse runs the same three steps backwards, which
/// leaves the lane holding a column again in time for the scatter.
///
/// The one coefficient that is both the group average (Haar level 0) and
/// the patch's spatial DC (DCT position 0) always survives the
/// threshold, whatever its magnitude. A group's mean brightness is
/// signal, not something a noise threshold should be able to zero out.
///
/// # Group weight
///
/// `group_weight` is `1 / sum(v_j)` over the coefficients the threshold
/// kept, computed from channel 0 only (luma dominates, and one weight
/// per group keeps aggregation simple downstream). When every member has
/// the same noise variance and the group keeps `n` coefficients this is
/// `1 / (sigma^2 * n)`, the usual inverse-variance weight, so a group
/// whose content agreed enough to keep more of its coefficients is
/// trusted more. Each lane sums the variance it retained over its own
/// eight positions and [`plane_ssd_reduce8`] folds the group's eight
/// partials together, which is why no shared array is needed for it.
///
/// # Buffers
///
/// `ring` is the frame ring, laid out one frame after another in
/// physical ring-slot order. `centre_slot` is the slot the pass is
/// centred on and `neighbour_slots` maps a packed neighbour index onto
/// its physical slot.
///
/// `accum` and `wsum` hold one region per ring slot, the layout
/// [`scatter_patch`] addresses, so a member matched in a neighbour frame
/// scatters into that frame's own region rather than the centre's.
/// `accum_scale` is the fixed-point scale that scatter converts into.
///
/// `group_weight` holds one weight per reference, and `sigma` one value
/// per stored channel.
///
/// `dct_profile` holds
/// [`crate::collab::kernels::transforms::dct_noise_profile`]'s 8 values.
/// Every member's coefficient variance at DCT position `(u, v)` scales
/// by `dct_profile[u] * dct_profile[v]` before the threshold reads it.
/// At `rho = 0` every entry is `1.0` and the multiply is a no-op.
///
/// `use_member_sigma` folds each temporal member's mismatch variance
/// into its own noise variance. False leaves every member on the plain
/// `sigma[c]^2`.
///
/// # Compilation cost
///
/// The group stays in registers because the transform loops unroll
/// fully rather than looping at run time. That unrolling is expensive
/// to compile, the unrolled IR is 6,513 instructions for the luma
/// variant and 11,903 for the chroma variant, and cubecl spends about
/// 9.5 s compiling the two of them at startup. That cost is the price
/// of the register-resident design, not a bug to fix by shrinking the
/// unroll.
