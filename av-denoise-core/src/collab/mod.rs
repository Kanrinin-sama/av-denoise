//! A BM3D-style collaborative filter core, used by the `nl4d` denoiser.
//!
//! Collaborative filtering cleans a frame by grouping similar patches
//! together and denoising the whole group at once, rather than pixel by
//! pixel. A reference patch collects a stack of the patches that match it
//! best, the stack is filtered as a unit, and the filtered results are
//! blended back onto the frame.
//!
//! [`geometry`] lays out the grid of reference patches a frame is covered
//! with, and sizes the buffers driven by that grid. [`kernels`] holds the
//! GPU code that does the grouping, filtering, and blending.
