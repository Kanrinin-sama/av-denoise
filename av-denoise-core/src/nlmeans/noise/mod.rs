//! Measuring how noisy a source is.
//!
//! The HQ variant matches its strength to the noise level, so it needs a
//! number for that level. This module produces one per frame.
//!
//! # Two ways of looking
//!
//! The Immerkær estimate runs a small mask over each frame that cancels
//! smooth content and leaves mostly noise. It is cheap and needs only
//! one frame, but it reads grain that is correlated between neighbouring
//! pixels too low, because such grain looks partly like content to the
//! mask.
//!
//! The temporal estimate compares a frame against the one before it.
//! Where nothing moved, whatever is left over is noise, and correlated
//! grain shows up in full. It needs static content to work, so motion
//! and scene changes make it unreliable.
//!
//! The two are combined by taking whichever reads higher, which lets the
//! temporal estimate correct an Immerkær under-read without letting an
//! unreliable one drag the estimate down.
//!
//! # Two chains
//!
//! The result feeds two separate smoothed estimates.
//!
//! The median chain reads typical noise and drives the filter strength.
//!
//! The low chain reads cautiously, using lower-quartile statistics, and
//! drives the distance floor. Reading that too high scrubs fine texture,
//! so it is deliberately the more conservative of the two.
