//! The GPU kernels the denoiser launches.
//!
//! Everything here is cubecl code that runs on the device. The host side
//! decides which kernels to launch and with what arguments, which is the
//! `dispatch` module's job.
//!
//! A denoise pass measures how alike patches are, turns those distances
//! into weights, accumulates the weighted pixels, and then normalises
//! the result.
//!
//! `fused` does the first three steps in one kernel, which is the fast
//! path for small patches. `separable` splits the distance step into
//! horizontal and vertical passes so the cost stays linear as patches
//! grow. `accumulate` holds the shared accumulation and normalisation
//! steps.
//!
//! `bilateral` is the prefilter, `noise` measures the noise level,
//! [`motion`] tracks movement between frames, `memory` holds the copy,
//! zero, and wire packing and unpacking utilities, and `helpers` holds
//! the small pieces the kernels share.
