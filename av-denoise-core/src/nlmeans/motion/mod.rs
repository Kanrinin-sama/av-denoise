//! Following motion between frames so temporal denoising stays sharp.
//!
//! Temporal denoising averages a pixel with the same position in nearby
//! frames. When the camera or the content moves, that position holds
//! different content in each frame, and averaging it blurs the moving
//! parts.
//!
//! This module works out where each block of pixels moved to, then
//! shifts the neighbouring frames back into line with the current one
//! before the denoising weights are computed.
//!
//! # How a frame is tracked
//!
//! `pyramid` builds a stack of progressively smaller copies of the luma
//! plane. A search on a small copy finds large movements cheaply, and
//! the answer then seeds a short search at full resolution.
//!
//! `analyse` runs that search. `chain` handles distant neighbours by
//! measuring motion between adjacent frames and joining the results,
//! which reaches further than any single search window.
//!
//! `confidence` scores how well each block actually matched, so a block
//! that was occluded or changed can be held back rather than blurred in.
//!
//! `compensate` applies the finished motion field to a frame.
