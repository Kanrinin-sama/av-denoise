//! The non-local means denoiser that sits behind [`crate::Denoiser`].
//!
//! Non-local means cleans a pixel by finding patches elsewhere that look
//! like the patch around it, then averaging them. Similar patches get a
//! large weight and dissimilar ones get almost none, so flat areas
//! smooth out while edges survive.
//!
//! The search can reach across neighbouring frames as well as within one
//! frame, which is what the temporal radius controls.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! `params` holds the tuning values and the calibrated defaults, and
//! [`NlmParams`] is the single struct everything else is built from.
//!
//! [`NlmDenoiser`] owns the GPU buffers and the frame ring, and
//! `dispatch` turns one set of parameters into the sequence of kernel
//! launches that produces a frame.
//!
//! [`kernels`] holds the GPU code itself. `noise` measures how noisy a
//! frame is, [`motion`] tracks movement between frames, and
//! [`prefilter`] builds the cleaner reference image that patches are
//! compared against.
