//! A `Pending` has to keep working after the denoiser that produced it
//! is dropped.
//!
//! The readback future is built inside an `async move` that owns a
//! cloned `ComputeClient`, which is what makes that safe. This test pins
//! that arrangement down.
//!
//! If a future cubecl release changes `read_async` so its future borrows
//! from the client, or if a refactor here brings back a
//! lifetime-erasing `transmute`, this test reaches freed memory. Miri
//! and ASan will catch it, and a plain build may fail too.
