## `src/benchmark_e2e.py`

End-to-end throughput benchmark. It reads a TOML config, runs every
variant in it, and reports wall-clock timings and amortized fps per
group.

```
just benchmark-e2e
just benchmark-e2e --group 1080p --only nl4d_base --repeats 3 --warmup
just benchmark-e2e --dry-run
```

A variant is a shell command. `{{input}}` is replaced with the input its
group names and `{{output}}` with a per-variant file under `output_dir`,
which is a temporary directory when the config leaves it out. Groups
exist so one set of commands can be measured against several inputs, such
as a 1080p clip and a 4K one.

Frame counts come from the `frame=` progress a run prints, and fall back
to a container probe of the input, which is what the checked-in config
relies on because its sinks are silenced. fps divides that count by the
wall clock, so startup, shader compilation, scene detection and the sink
all count against it.

A variant may also carry an `env` table, whose entries are added to the
environment its command runs in. The checked-in config pins no GPU. Each
stack reads its card from a variable, and all three count in PCI order, so
one index selects one card across the lot:

```
AVD_DEVICE=discrete:1 BENCH_OCL_DEVICE=1 BENCH_HIP_DEVICE=1 just benchmark-e2e
```

`AVD_DEVICE` goes to av-denoise through Vulkan, `BENCH_OCL_DEVICE` is the
device half of ffmpeg's `ocl:0.N`, and `BENCH_HIP_DEVICE` is V-BM3D's HIP
index. A single variant can override any of them through `env`.

The V-BM3D variants run `vs/vbm3d_denoise.vpy` under VapourSynth, which
needs the `vs` dependency group. `uv run --group vs` installs it on first
use, so nothing has to be set up by hand.

See `configs/benchmark_e2e.toml` for the config the recipe runs by
default. It measures seven variants against a 1080p clip and a 4K one.
